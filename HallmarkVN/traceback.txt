I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 144, in script
    mc neutral "You, [mc], are a junior reporter for Buzzread - the internet’s most popular news outlet specializing in 60-second viral news videos and hard hitting, investigative listicle journalism."
  File "renpy/common/00library.rpy", line 284, in say
    who(what, interact=interact, *args, **kwargs)
Exception: Say has image attributes ('neutral',), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
