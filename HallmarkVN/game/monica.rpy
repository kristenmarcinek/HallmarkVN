    "Evening."

    "You order take-out from the only Chinese restaurant in town: Panda Cafe. Luckily, it just so happens to be right around the corner so it’s a quick walk there and back."

    "Not only does it get you out of the cold quicker but the chances of you running into anyone else from high school today are slim to none. A win-win."

    "When you get back to the hotel room Monica is sitting cross-legged on the bed, clicking through TV channels."

    m "There’s {b}nothing but shitty Christmas movies on! Look!{/b}"

    "Sure enough, as Monica clicks through the channels your senses are bombarded by the gaudy, cheerful, tell-tell staples of the Christmas movie genre."

    "You see ugly sweater after ugly sweater, plaid, tinsel, wrapping paper, kisses under the mistletoe. Monica flips through 10 channels, just to get her point across - a different movie on each of them."

    mc neutral "Oh. Yeah."

    m "You mean you {b}knew{/b} about this?"

    mc "I mean... yeah. They do it every year. You get the news in the morning and at night, but otherwise pretty much every channel is just… that crap."
